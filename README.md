## Technologies Used

This project uses HTML5 and CSS along with Canvas technologies for the UI, output and interactions. 

It also uses DOM and Javascript for the logic of the game.

## Approach

The approach I used for this project I broke into three parts in order:

1. Front-End User Experience
  - Construct the basic template in HTML I will use as the main content container within the body of the HTML.
  - Use CSS for essential styling of the contents.
  - Ensure html elements were properly organized and tagged with their own unique id's.

2. Basic gameplay functionality (I like to call primary functionality)
  - These primaries were: 
        - The randomly generated enemies 
        - Their attack movement
        - Bomb/death interactions 
        - And finally record keeping
